qb-vehiclekeys but working with ps-ui circle minigame

There is a few versions on here but they are outdated versions of qb-vehiclekeys. 
This will allow you to lockpick the door and hotwire the vehicle using the ps-ui circle minigame export.
Since this is the newest version of qb-vehiclekeys you can adjust it in the config if you would like to have driving npc's doors be locked or unlocked by default,
same with parked cars. Enjoy!


Thanks to Crazy#7388 for the help with getting the lockpicking working, the people at qbcore-framework for creating the original qb-vehiclekeys repo and to all the guys at ProjectSloth for the ps-ui minigame and help adding it in!

# Install
Delete your current qb-vehiclekeys script and just simply drag and drop this one into your resources folder and make sure to remove the -main from the file.
